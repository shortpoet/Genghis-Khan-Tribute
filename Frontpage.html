    <p>The closest depiction generally accepted by most historians is the portrait currently in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan, which was drawn under the supervision of his grandson Khubilai during the Mongol Yuan dynasty and depicts Genghis Khan with typical Mongol features. </p>

  <h2> Timeline </h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li> Probably 1155, 1162, or 1167: Temüjin was born in the Khentii mountains. </li>
    <li>When Temüjin was nine, his father Yesükhei was poisoned by Tatars, leaving Temüjin and his family destitute.</li>
   <li> c. 1184: Temüjin's wife Börte was kidnapped by Merkits; he called on blood brother Jamukha and Wang Khan for aid, and they rescued her. </li>
   <li> c. 1185: First son Jochi was born; leading to doubt about his paternity later among Genghis's children, because he was born shortly after Börte's rescue from the Merkits.</li>
  <li> 1190: Temüjin united the Mongol tribes, became leader, and devised code of law Yassa. </li>
  <li> 1201: Victory over Jamukha's Jadarans. </li>
  <li> 1202: Adopted as Wang Khan's heir after successful campaigns against Tatars. </li>
    <li> 1203: Victory over Wang Khan's Keraites. Wang Khan himself killed by accident by allied Naimans. </li>
  <li> 1204: Victory over Naimans (all these confederations unite and become the Mongols). </li>
   <li> 1206: Jamukha was killed. Temüjin was given the title Genghis Khan by his followers in a Kurultai (around 40 years of age). </li>
    <li> 1207–1210: Genghis led operations against the Western Xia, which comprises much of northwestern China and parts of Tibet. Western Xia ruler submitted to Genghis Khan. During this period, the Uyghurs also submitted peacefully to the Mongols and became valued administrators throughout the empire. </li>
    <li> 1211: After the kurultai, Genghis led his armies against the Jin dynasty ruling northern China. </li>
  <li> 1215: Beijing fell; Genghis Khan turned to west and the Khara-Kitan Khanate. </li>
  <li> 1219–1222: Conquered Khwarezmid Empire. </li>
    <li> 1226: Started the campaign against the Western Xia for forming coalition against the Mongols, the second battle with the Western Xia. </li>
    <li>1227: Genghis Khan died after conquering the Tangut people. Cause of death is uncertain, although legend states that he was thrown off his horse in the battle and contracted a deadly fever soon after.</li>

    <p> Genghis is claimed to be one of the most virile and prolific creators of genetic legacies.  Some estimates place it as high as 1-in-200 men sharing his genetic lineage.</p>
 
    <p> Here are some links to articles that discuss the topic. </p>

    </ul>
    
<p> As a counterpoint, there are also other men who are claimed to be cases of "super-Y-lineages." </p>
